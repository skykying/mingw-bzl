# mxebzl
MXE cross compiler configuration for Bazel

## Adding the MXE compilers to your WORKSPACE

In your `WORKSPACE` file, reference this repository. Then load and
create the compilers repository and specify your dependencies.

```
git_repository(
    name = "mxebzl",
    remote = "https://github.com/skykying/mingw-bzl.git",
    tag = "20181103_RC02",  # Adjust as needed
)

load("@mxebzl//tools:repository.bzl", "mxe_compilers")
mxe_compilers(
    deps = [
        "compiler",
        # "SDL2",
        # "sqlite",
        # etc...
    ],
)
```

When you build your project, tell `bazel` about the configuration and
cpu architecture:

```
$ bazel build \
    --crosstool_top=@mxebzl//tools/windows:toolchain
    --cpu=win64 # or win32
    :hello_world
```

## Addons

MXE has many useful libraries, but occasionally there will be something
you want to add on which is not part of the MXE distribution, such as
the python interpreter.  Package the header and library resources similarly
to MXE, put the `.tar.xz` archive into the addons directory, and then
reference your package in the `deps` section of your `mxe_compilers` rule.

If your addon requires additional runtime components, you can add them
to the `runtimes` directory.

## Packaging your executable

You can also use the `pkg_winzip` rule to create a `zip` archive with your
executable, required DLLs and any other specified resources.

In your BUILD file:

```
package(default_visibility = ['//visibility:public'])
load("@mxebzl//tools/windows:rules.bzl", "pkg_winzip")

cc_binary(
    name = 'hello',
    srcs = ['hello.c'],
)

pkg_winzip(
    name = "hello-windows",
    files = [
        ":hello",
        # maybe some other non-exe resources, like a 'content' directory.
    ],
    skip_dlls = [
        # Any system DLLs the dependency analyzer says you need but you
        # aren't shipping with your package.
        # "winmm.dll",
        # etc...
    ],
    zips = [
        # Any additional content you want to combine into your package
        # (e.g. "@mxebzl//runtime/python37")
    ],
    out = "whatever.zip", # Optional: defaults to ${name}.zip
)
```

As when building the binary, you also need to tell bazel about the
configuration when you build the package archive:

```
$ bazel build \
    --crosstool_top=@mxebzl//tools/windows:toolchain
    --cpu=win64 # or win32
    :hello-windows
```

After the build finishes, there will be a `hello-windows.zip` in the `bazel-bin`
directory.
